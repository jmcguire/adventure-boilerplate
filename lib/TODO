This directory holds all the python libraries for our custom markdown extensions.

Eventually it'll have to be put in a proper directory format, which will probably be something wordy like lib/python/2.7/adventure-boilerplate/

Extensions I need to write for version 1:

 - statblock
 - wrap content in main tag

Extensions for future versions:

 - special formatting for the author h2
 - recognize a dice options ol, and give it a class
 - append a custom css
 - add contact info to author h2, like social media icons
 - npc formatting, with dialog stuff
 - wrap each h2 section in section tag
 - create general menu from h2 tags
 - create scene menu from the h3 tags in the scene section
 - do something for the paper book references, like DMG 100
 - do something for the open document references
 - add google tracking code
 - use meta data in the md file, in place of the command line, for:
    - title
    - license
    - location of custom css file
    - google tracking code
    - parallax image
