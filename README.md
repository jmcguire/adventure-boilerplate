# adventure-boilerplate

HTML/CSS Boilerplate (and one-click Markdown conversion) for RPG Adventures. Currently supporting D&amp;D 5e.

## Description

Authors should be proud of how their adventures look. This project gives that to them. Using simple HTML, or even simpler Markdown, adventure authors will be able to produce a great-looking adventure.

This project is really two project mooshed together.

**The first part is HTML/CSS boilerplate for Dungeons and Dragons adventures.** Inspired by the HTML5 boierplate project, this aims to be an easy-to-use CSS file and HTML standard that anyone can use to markup their adventure with.

The result will be a readable and typography-designed webpage. It will work well on screens, tablets, mobile devices, and will even print beautifully.

**The second part is an adventure markdown converter.** People who don't know HTML should still be able to build a nice looking adventure.

We're accomplishing that by using the simple and increasingly-common Markdown language. Authors will be able to write a markdown document, then run a simple build script called "build.sh", and an entire HTML website will be produced for them.

We're using Python markdown, with some custom extensions to make a lot of magic happen.

## Installation

Download, write an adventure using markdown. Then run the build.sh command.

## Usage

Run the build.sh command. Further documentation coming when the build.sh command is in build.
